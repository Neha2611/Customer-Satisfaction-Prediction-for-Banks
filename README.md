**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting customer behavior for banks using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a structured dataset to build models that help identify patterns in customer interactions, such as predicting churn, identifying potential loan defaulters, or segmenting customers based on specific criteria.

**Objectives**

Analyze customer data to derive meaningful insights.

Build predictive models to improve decision-making in banking operations.

Evaluate model performance and refine it for better predictions.

**Dataset**

The dataset used contains the following features:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Demographic Features: Age, Gender, Location, etc.

Behavioral Features: Transaction history, account activity, product usage, etc.

Target Variable: A binary or categorical variable indicating the desired prediction (e.g., Churn: Yes/No).

**Data Preprocessing**

Handling missing values through imputation.

Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.

Scaling numerical features to standardize the data.

Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

**Methodology**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions of key features.

Identified correlations between variables.

Highlighted outliers and anomalies in the dataset.
